Create a facebook page and link the same in newly created app in https://developers.facebook.com/. Generate token in the dashboard page for the app. Expose the local express server using ngrok and get the URL and provide it in the webhooks section. Now save all the changes in the app and save it. 

Now, if you ping from the created facebook page, the node bot will respond to it. As of now, it will respond only to specific set of messages.
